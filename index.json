I opened a code editor, ready to write my first lines\u0026hellip; and BAM! I came across a chunk of C code filled with braces, semicolons, and incomprehensible stuff. I tried to understand it, but it felt like I was deciphering an alien language.\nThen, I discovered Python.\nIt was simple, readable, and most importantly, it worked right away without any hassle. A real game-changer. If you’re looking for your first programming language, let me explain why Python is THE best choice.\n1. A Syntax that Won’t Overwhelm You # When you\u0026rsquo;re starting out, you don\u0026rsquo;t want to struggle with complicated syntax. Python is literally pseudo-code that even a normal human can read. No need to handle braces or long type declarations.\nCheck out this piece of Python code:\ndef greet(name): print(f\u0026#34;Hello, {name}!\u0026#34;) greet(\u0026#34;You\u0026#34;) It’s clean, simple, and to the point. Now, try doing the same thing in Java or C and get ready to cry.\n2. A Swiss Army Knife for Everything # When you\u0026rsquo;re learning a language, it’s better if it’s useful, right? Python can be used for everything:\nWeb development (Django, Flask) Task automation (scripts to save time) Data science and machine learning (Pandas, TensorFlow) Cybersecurity (Pentesting, log analysis) In short, it’s not just a language \u0026ldquo;for learning\u0026rdquo;, it’s a real tool you can use for a long time.\n3. A Community That’s Got Your Back # Another big strength of Python is its community. Stuck? There\u0026rsquo;s always someone who had the same problem as you and posted the solution on Stack Overflow.\nAnd actually, on memlenz, I’ve set up a Courses section where you can learn Python at your own pace, without getting lost in all directions.\n4. Learn the Basics Without Struggling # When you start coding, you need a language that lets you learn logic before getting bogged down with technical details.\nWith Python, you can focus on the essentials:\n✅ Variables, conditions, loops\n✅ Functions, object-oriented programming\n✅ File and exception handling\nAnd since it’s an interpreted language, there’s no need to compile after every test. You run your code and instantly see what works (or what breaks).\n5. Python Isn’t Just for Beginners # Some people think Python is just for beginners. Wrong! Big companies like Google, Netflix, and Tesla use it for serious development. This means if you become good at Python, you can use it in a variety of jobs:\n🚀 Web Developer\n📊 Data Scientist\n🔐 Cybersecurity Expert\n🤖 Artificial Intelligence Engineer\nSo yeah, learning Python isn’t just \u0026ldquo;for beginners\u0026rdquo;, it’s also an investment for the future.\nConclusion: Go Learn Python # If I had to start with another language, I might have given up along the way. Fortunately, Python showed me that coding can be simple and fun.\nAnd if you want to learn Python with a structured and well-explained course, I’ve set it all up in the Courses section of the blog:\n👉 Access the Python course here\nGo ahead, your turn! 🚀\n","date":"15 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/langage/python/why-python-is-excelent/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"Why Python is an Excellent First Language","type":"blog"},{"content":"Dans ce coin du blog, nous allons plonger dans l\u0026rsquo;univers fascinant des langages de programmation.

The Turning Point: How I Won with Linux 🚀 # I didn’t switch to Linux because it was trendy. I switched because I was fed up with limitations.\nIt all started in my first year of computer science at the IUT of Parakou. A classmate had an insane desktop setup. It looked like a hacker\u0026rsquo;s dream. When I asked, he casually said,\n💬 \u0026ldquo;Oh, that\u0026rsquo;s just Kali Linux.\u0026rdquo;\nThat was the first time I saw an OS that wasn’t Windows. Back in 2023, Windows 10 was the standard, and I never questioned it. But after that encounter, my curiosity kicked in.\nI installed Kali Linux on VirtualBox and started tinkering. The command line immediately hooked me it was powerful, direct, efficient. I even avoided the GUI, trying to do everything in CLI. It felt like hacking the system, but for real.\nBut I had a problem:\n🛑 I was still stuck on Windows for coding, testing, and studying.\nThen, one day, Windows broke me.\nI was working on a C project, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t type \u0026lt; and \u0026gt; properly. Instead of just pressing two keys, I had to either open the on-screen keyboard or memorize awkward combinations (Alt+60, Alt+62). Ridiculous.\nFrustrated, I searched for solutions and came across a Linux dev’s tutorial. Out of curiosity, I tested his setup and discovered:\nShift + Alt + W for \u0026lt; and Shift + Alt + X for \u0026gt;.\nThat was it.\n💥 The moment I decided I would never code on Windows again.\nI started using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), then dual-booted Linux, until I finally wiped Windows completely. And I’ve never looked back.\n2. The Frustrations I Left Behind ❌ # ❌ No control – Windows and macOS dictate how you use your system. I wanted freedom.\n❌ Performance issues – Windows slows down with every update. Linux stays fast and efficient.\n❌ Bloatware \u0026amp; background processes – I hated unnecessary software eating up resources.\n❌ Forced updates – Windows decides when to restart. Linux lets me be in control.\nSwitching to Linux wasn’t just about the OS. It was about taking full ownership of my computing experience.\n3. What I Gained with Linux 🏆 # ✅ Speed \u0026amp; efficiency – My system runs like a dream. No lag, no random slowdowns.\n✅ Total customization – Everything is built to fit my workflow perfectly.\n✅ Privacy \u0026amp; security – No forced telemetry. No hidden data collection.\n✅ A hacker mindset – Learning Linux taught me how computers actually work.\nLinux didn’t just change my OS. It changed how I think about technology.\n4. My Linux Journey: From Chaos to Mastery 🛤️ # I didn’t master Linux overnight. I broke my system countless times, reinstalled everything, and experimented like crazy.\nHere’s how my Linux evolution went:\nKali Linux – My first experience, but too niche for daily use. Ubuntu WSL \u0026amp; MX Linux – First real steps into the Linux world. Linux Mint – User-friendly, but too bloated for me. Arch Linux – Full control, but installation was brutal. Void Linux – My final choice: fast, minimal, and powerful. Every mistake I made taught me something new.\n5. The Game-Changing Discoveries 💡 # 💡 Tiling Window Managers (i3, bspwm) → My workflow became lightning fast.\n💡 Package Management – Learning Pacman (Arch), APT (Debian), XBPS (Void).\n💡 Dotfiles \u0026amp; Minimalist Configs – Customizing my environment to perfection.\nEach of these boosted my productivity and efficiency beyond what I thought was possible.\n6. Why Void Linux Won Me Over 🏆 # 💨 Super lightweight – No unnecessary services slowing me down.\n⚡ XBPS package manager – Faster and simpler than APT or Pacman.\n🚀 No systemd – More control over my init system.\n🔄 Rolling release – Always up to date without breaking my setup.\nVoid Linux isn’t for everyone. But for power users who want simplicity and speed, it’s unbeatable.\n7. Why You Should Consider Linux in 2025 📅 # 💡 Stop depending on Big Tech companies controlling your system.\n💡 Get real performance gains – No forced obsolescence.\n💡 Own your data – No background tracking, telemetry, or forced cloud sync.\n💡 Join an open-source revolution – A community built on collaboration.\nWindows and macOS are products.\nLinux is a philosophy.\n8. My Advice for Linux Newcomers 🎯 # 🟢 Start with the right distro – Ubuntu/Mint if you\u0026rsquo;re new, Arch/Void if you love tinkering.\n🟢 Learn the terminal – cd, ls, mv, grep will change your life.\n🟢 Break things \u0026amp; learn – Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to experiment.\n🟢 Join a community – Reddit, Discord, Linux forums are goldmines of knowledge.\n🟢 Optimize your workflow – Neovim, Tmux, Fish/Zsh, and dotfiles will take you to the next level.\n9. Conclusion: More Than Just an OS 🔥 # Linux isn’t just software it’s a way of thinking. It forces you to understand your system, customize it, and push it to its full potential.\n💡 If you’re tired of closed ecosystems, slow performance, and restrictions, Linux is your way out.\n🔥 Follow my journey as I share tutorials, configurations, and deep dives into the Linux world.\n🚀 Ready to break free?
