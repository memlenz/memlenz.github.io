The Turning Point: How I Won with Linux 🚀 # I didn’t switch to Linux because it was trendy. I switched because I was fed up with limitations.\nIt all started in my first year of computer science at the IUT of Parakou. A classmate had an insane desktop setup. It looked like a hacker\u0026rsquo;s dream. When I asked, he casually said,\n💬 \u0026ldquo;Oh, that\u0026rsquo;s just Kali Linux.\u0026rdquo;\nThat was the first time I saw an OS that wasn’t Windows. Back in 2023, Windows 10 was the standard, and I never questioned it. But after that encounter, my curiosity kicked in.\nI installed Kali Linux on VirtualBox and started tinkering. The command line immediately hooked me it was powerful, direct, efficient. I even avoided the GUI, trying to do everything in CLI. It felt like hacking the system, but for real.\nBut I had a problem:\n🛑 I was still stuck on Windows for coding, testing, and studying.\nThen, one day, Windows broke me.\nI was working on a C project, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t type \u0026lt; and \u0026gt; properly. Instead of just pressing two keys, I had to either open the on-screen keyboard or memorize awkward combinations (Alt+60, Alt+62). Ridiculous.\nFrustrated, I searched for solutions and came across a Linux dev’s tutorial. Out of curiosity, I tested his setup and discovered:\nShift + Alt + W for \u0026lt; and Shift + Alt + X for \u0026gt;.\nThat was it.\n💥 The moment I decided I would never code on Windows again.\nI started using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), then dual-booted Linux, until I finally wiped Windows completely. And I’ve never looked back.\n2. The Frustrations I Left Behind ❌ # ❌ No control – Windows and macOS dictate how you use your system. I wanted freedom.\n❌ Performance issues – Windows slows down with every update. Linux stays fast and efficient.\n❌ Bloatware \u0026amp; background processes – I hated unnecessary software eating up resources.\n❌ Forced updates – Windows decides when to restart. Linux lets me be in control.\nSwitching to Linux wasn’t just about the OS. It was about taking full ownership of my computing experience.\n3. What I Gained with Linux 🏆 # ✅ Speed \u0026amp; efficiency – My system runs like a dream. No lag, no random slowdowns.\n✅ Total customization – Everything is built to fit my workflow perfectly.\n✅ Privacy \u0026amp; security – No forced telemetry. No hidden data collection.\n✅ A hacker mindset – Learning Linux taught me how computers actually work.\nLinux didn’t just change my OS. It changed how I think about technology.\n4. My Linux Journey: From Chaos to Mastery 🛤️ # I didn’t master Linux overnight. I broke my system countless times, reinstalled everything, and experimented like crazy.\nHere’s how my Linux evolution went:\nKali Linux – My first experience, but too niche for daily use. Ubuntu WSL \u0026amp; MX Linux – First real steps into the Linux world. Linux Mint – User-friendly, but too bloated for me. Arch Linux – Full control, but installation was brutal. Void Linux – My final choice: fast, minimal, and powerful. Every mistake I made taught me something new.\n5. The Game-Changing Discoveries 💡 # 💡 Tiling Window Managers (i3, bspwm) → My workflow became lightning fast.\n💡 Package Management – Learning Pacman (Arch), APT (Debian), XBPS (Void).\n💡 Dotfiles \u0026amp; Minimalist Configs – Customizing my environment to perfection.\nEach of these boosted my productivity and efficiency beyond what I thought was possible.\n6. Why Void Linux Won Me Over 🏆 # 💨 Super lightweight – No unnecessary services slowing me down.\n⚡ XBPS package manager – Faster and simpler than APT or Pacman.\n🚀 No systemd – More control over my init system.\n🔄 Rolling release – Always up to date without breaking my setup.\nVoid Linux isn’t for everyone. But for power users who want simplicity and speed, it’s unbeatable.\n7. Why You Should Consider Linux in 2025 📅 # 💡 Stop depending on Big Tech companies controlling your system.\n💡 Get real performance gains – No forced obsolescence.\n💡 Own your data – No background tracking, telemetry, or forced cloud sync.\n💡 Join an open-source revolution – A community built on collaboration.\nWindows and macOS are products.\nLinux is a philosophy.\n8. My Advice for Linux Newcomers 🎯 # 🟢 Start with the right distro – Ubuntu/Mint if you\u0026rsquo;re new, Arch/Void if you love tinkering.\n🟢 Learn the terminal – cd, ls, mv, grep will change your life.\n🟢 Break things \u0026amp; learn – Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to experiment.\n🟢 Join a community – Reddit, Discord, Linux forums are goldmines of knowledge.\n🟢 Optimize your workflow – Neovim, Tmux, Fish/Zsh, and dotfiles will take you to the next level.\n9. Conclusion: More Than Just an OS 🔥 # Linux isn’t just software it’s a way of thinking. It forces you to understand your system, customize it, and push it to its full potential.\n💡 If you’re tired of closed ecosystems, slow performance, and restrictions, Linux is your way out.\n🔥 Follow my journey as I share tutorials, configurations, and deep dives into the Linux world.\n🚀 Ready to break free?
